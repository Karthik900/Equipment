# Equipment Database Web Application

## Installation

This Project requires Django, Django REST Framework serving as the Backend Technologies.

> Note: The instructions given below are supposed to be followed after the concerned person already has python3+ as well as pip3 installed and added to path in their machine. I've used PyCharm as the IDE for Python for this project. Although I built this on Windows OS, the process is similiar for Linux and can be executed with no difficulty.

### Django, REST Framework

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following commands 
   * ```pip install Django``` for installation of Django framework.
   * ```pip install djangorestframework``` for the rest framework.
   * ```pip install markdown``` for markdown support for the browsable API.
   * ```pip install django-filter``` for filtering support.
3. You can check this [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for reference purposes and other download methods.

## Getting the Web App running

1. Move to the project directory and open it in your terminal.
2. Run ```python manage.py runserver```
3. You should be able to see the default local server on which the web app is functioning i.e something like this
